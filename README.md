# file_browser

This program is Open Source licensed with the MIT license, giving people maximum freedom to continue development.  

This program is a creation of mine that I have been imagining and occasionally attempting to code since the late 1980's.  
It provides a somewhat graphical approach to displaying and navigating your directory structure on a Mac (Apple computer).  
It only runs on Apple computers right now, because that is what I have.  

When you first start the program it shows you your home directory with a box for each item (directory or file).  
Then you click on an item to descend the hierarchy into that item.  You click on blank space to navigate up in the hierarchy.  
That's it for now, many features are possible, making this a useful file browser.  

This program can be the basis of a new graphical operating system, or at least that is the dream.  
Please feel free to download and distribute the application.  The program is Open Source, however some friends of mine are
adding value in some way so you can buy it for a low price and in that way provide for the development of new software.  
We do not know just how they will add value but they will do so soon.  It will be a download that I mention here in the future.  

Thanks for downloading the file and please make anhy suggestions or feature requests as you deem appropriate.  
I type my full name below with the date because there are many imitators (why I dont's know, but there they are), Crazy huh?

p.s. This is a Processing file set.  You can download Processing from www.Procesing.org and put the files in a directory (folder)
of the same name (file_browser_15) so Processing knows what to do with the files, that is just how Processing works.  Good luck!
